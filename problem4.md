### Multiplication two number 

Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.

**Note**: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly. use solution from **problem 2** and **problem 3** instead

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
Example 2:
```

```
Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

```go
func multiply(num1 string, num2 string) string {
    
}
```
